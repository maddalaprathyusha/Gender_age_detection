Age and Gender Detection using OpenCV and Deep Learning

This project performs **real-time age and gender prediction** from images or webcam input using pre-trained deep learning models in OpenCV.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The goal is to detect human faces and classify:
- **Gender**: Male / Female
- **Age**: One of the 8 categories â€”  
  `(0-2)`, `(4-6)`, `(8-12)`, `(15-20)`, `(25-32)`, `(38-43)`, `(48-53)`, `(60-100)`

**Face Detection & Pre-trained Models**
Face detection is done using a DNN-based face detector from OpenCV (opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb and opencv_face_detector.pbtxt).

**CNN Architecture Used**
The architecture includes:

Convolutional Layer 1: 96 filters, kernel size 7Ã—7

Convolutional Layer 2: 256 filters, kernel size 5Ã—5

Convolutional Layer 3: 384 filters, kernel size 3Ã—3

Fully Connected Layers: Two layers with 512 nodes each

Output Layer: Softmax layer for classification



**Age and gender prediction uses:**

.prototxt files â†’ define the model architecture

.caffemodel files â†’ contain the trained weights

**Models:**
Age: age_deploy.prototxt and age_net.caffemodel

Gender: gender_deploy.prototxt and gender_net.caffemodel

**Process of working:**

Detect faces in the input image or webcam feed.

Crop and preprocess the face region.

Pass it through the pre-trained CNN models.

Predict gender and age group.

Display results (bounding box + labels) on screen.


**Requirements**
Python 3.x

OpenCV (opencv-python)

NumPy

**Output:**

Mean values for model normalization: [78.4263377603, 87.7689143744, 114.895847746]

Classification is performed using Softmax.

The code supports image input and live webcam detection.

The model is classification-based, not regression, due to difficulty in exact age estimation.
